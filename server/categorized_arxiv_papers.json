            "summary": "Topology reasoning is crucial for autonomous driving as it enables\ncomprehensive understanding of connectivity and relationships between lanes and\ntraffic elements. While recent approaches have shown success in perceiving\ndriving topology using vehicle-mounted sensors, their scalability is hindered\nby the reliance on training data captured by consistent sensor configurations.\nWe identify that the key factor in scalable lane perception and topology\nreasoning is the elimination of this sensor-dependent feature. To address this,\nwe propose SMART, a scalable solution that leverages easily available\nstandard-definition (SD) and satellite maps to learn a map prior model,\nsupervised by large-scale geo-referenced high-definition (HD) maps independent\nof sensor settings. Attributed to scaled training, SMART alone achieves\nsuperior offline lane topology understanding using only SD and satellite\ninputs. Extensive experiments further demonstrate that SMART can be seamlessly\nintegrated into any online topology reasoning methods, yielding significant\nimprovements of up to 28% on the OpenLane-V2 benchmark.",

Towards formally verifying properties of\nstochastic systems, methods based on discrete, finite Markov approximations --\nabstractions -- thereof have surged in recent years. These are found in\ncontexts where: either a) one only has partial, discrete observations of the\nunderlying continuous stochastic process, or b) the original system is too\ncomplex to analyze, so one partitions the continuous state-space of the\noriginal system to construct a handleable, finite-state model thereof. In both\ncases, the abstraction is an approximation of the discrete stochastic process\nthat arises precisely from the discretization of the underlying continuous\nprocess. The fact that the abstraction is Markov and the discrete process is\nnot (even though the original one is) leads to approximation errors. Towards\naccounting for non-Markovianity, we introduce memory-dependent abstractions for\nstochastic systems, capturing dynamics with memory effects. Our contribution is\ntwofold. First, we provide a formalism for memory-dependent abstractions based\non transfer operators. Second, we quantify the approximation error by upper\nbounding the total variation distance between the true continuous state\ndistribution and its discrete approximation.",

Soft\nrobotic hands try to address this by leveraging passive compliance, a\ncharacteristic that is crucial to the adaptability of the human hand, to\nachieve more robust manipulation while reducing reliance on high-resolution\nsensing and complex control. Further improvements in terms of precision and\npostural stability in manipulation tasks are achieved through the integration\nof variable stiffness mechanisms, but these tend to lack residual compliance,\nbe bulky and have slow response times. To address these limitations, this work\nintroduces a Compliant Joint Jamming mechanism for anthropomorphic fingers that\nexhibits passive residual compliance and adjustable stiffness, while achieving\na range of motion in line with that of human interphalangeal joints. The\nstiffness range provided by the mechanism is controllable from 0.48 Nm/rad to\n1.95 Nm/rad (a 4x increase). Repeatability, hysteresis and stiffness were also\ncharacterized as a function of the jamming force.

While some open-source alternatives have\nemerged, there is still a notable lag behind specialized single-modality models\nin performance. In this paper, we present Ola, an Omni-modal language model\nthat achieves competitive performance across image, video, and audio\nunderstanding compared to specialized counterparts. The core design of Ola lies\nin its progressive modality alignment strategy that extends the supporting\nmodality of the language model progressively. Our training pipeline begins with\nthe most distinct modalities: image and text, then gradually expands the skill\nsets of the model using speech data that connects language and audio knowledge,\nand video data that connects all modalities. The progressive learning pipeline\nalso enables us to maintain a relatively small size of the cross-modal\nalignment data, making developing omni-modal from existing vision-language\nmodels easy and less costly. Moreover, to unlock an advanced interactive\nexperience like GPT-4o, we further design a sentence-wise decoding solution for\nstreaming speech generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ola\nsurpasses existing open omni-modal LLMs across all modalities while achieving\nhighly competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art specialized models\nof similar sizes. We aim to make Ola a fully open omni-modal understanding\nsolution to advance future research in this emerging field.

In this work, we overcome these limitations\nby analyzing the pointwise and spectral consistency of the augmentation graph\nLaplacian. We establish that, under specific conditions for data generation and\ngraph connectivity, as the augmented dataset size increases, the augmentation\ngraph Laplacian converges to a weighted Laplace-Beltrami operator on the\nnatural data manifold. These consistency results ensure that the graph\nLaplacian spectrum effectively captures the manifold geometry.

Shot design, a critical\naspect of filmmaking, involves meticulously planning both camera movements and\nobject motions in a scene. However, enabling intuitive shot design in modern\nimage-to-video generation systems presents two main challenges: first,\neffectively capturing user intentions on the motion design, where both camera\nmovements and scene-space object motions must be specified jointly; and second,\nrepresenting motion information that can be effectively utilized by a video\ndiffusion model to synthesize the image animations.

Given a crease pattern,\nwe consider a uniformly random assignment of mountain and valley creases,\nconditioned on the assignment being flat-foldable at each vertex. A natural\nmethod to approximately sample from this distribution is via the face-flip\nMarkov chain where one selects a face of the crease pattern uniformly at random\nand, if possible, flips all edges of that face from mountain to valley and\nvice-versa. We prove that this chain mixes rapidly for several natural families\nof origami tessellations -- the square twist, the square grid, and the\nMiura-ori -- as well as for the single-vertex crease pattern. We also compare\nlocal to global flat-foldability and show that on the square grid, a random\nlocally flat-foldable configuration is exponentially unlikely to be globally\nflat-foldable.",

In this paper, we show that the\ncommon practice of individually exploiting the text or image encoders of these\npowerful multi-modal models is highly suboptimal for intra-modal tasks like\nimage-to-image retrieval. We argue that this is inherently due to the\nCLIP-style inter-modal contrastive loss that does not enforce any intra-modal\nconstraints, leading to what we call intra-modal misalignment. To demonstrate\nthis, we leverage two optimization-based modality inversion techniques that map\nrepresentations from their input modality to the complementary one without any\nneed for auxiliary data or additional trained adapters. We empirically show\nthat, in the intra-modal tasks of image-to-image and text-to-text retrieval,\napproaching these tasks inter-modally significantly improves performance with\nrespect to intra-modal baselines on more than fifteen datasets. Additionally,\nwe demonstrate that approaching a native inter-modal task (e.g. zero-shot image\nclassification) intra-modally decreases performance, further validating our\nfindings. Finally, we show that incorporating an intra-modal term in the\npre-training objective or narrowing the modality gap between the text and image\nfeature embedding spaces helps reduce the intra-modal misalignment.

However, when implemented\nnaively, fine-tuning on new attacks degrades robustness on previous attacks.\nThis raises the question: how can we improve the initial training and\nfine-tuning of the model to simultaneously achieve robustness against previous\nand new attacks? We present theoretical results which show that the gap in a\nmodel's robustness against different attacks is bounded by how far each attack\nperturbs a sample in the model's logit space, suggesting that regularizing with\nrespect to this logit space distance can help maintain robustness against\nprevious attacks.

In\nthis work, we show that in deep clustering, competitive performance with more\ncomplex state-of-the-art methods can be achieved using a text-free and highly\nsimplified training pipeline. In particular, our approach, Simple Clustering\nvia Pre-trained models (SCP), trains only a small cluster head while leveraging\npre-trained vision model feature representations and positive data pairs.\nExperiments on benchmark datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-20, CIFAR-100,\nSTL-10, ImageNet-10, and ImageNet-Dogs, demonstrate that SCP achieves highly\ncompetitive performance. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical result\nexplaining why, at least under ideal conditions, additional text-based\nembeddings may not be necessary to achieve strong clustering performance in\nvision.",

This,\nat scale, can lead to diminishing returns and even hurt the models' performance\nand robustness.

However, this\nflexibility often introduces code quality issues, with prior studies showing\nthat approximately 76% of public notebooks are non-executable, raising\nsignificant concerns about reusability. We argue that the traditional notion of\nexecutability - requiring a notebook to run fully and without error - is overly\nrigid, misclassifying many notebooks and overestimating their\nnon-executability. This paper investigates pathological executability issues in\npublic notebooks under varying notions and degrees of executability. Even\npartially improving executability can improve code comprehension and offer a\npathway for dynamic analyses. With this insight, we first categorize notebooks\ninto potentially restorable and pathological non-executable notebooks and then\nmeasure how removing misconfiguration and superficial execution issues in\nnotebooks can improve their executability (i.e., additional cells executed\nwithout error). In a dataset of 42,546 popular public notebooks containing\n34,659 non-executable notebooks, only 21.3% are truly pathologically\nnon-executable. For restorable notebooks, LLM-based methods fully restore 5.4%\nof previously non-executable notebooks.

This should ideally be one that is not necessarily only\nsynonymous, but also fits well into the surrounding context of the target word,\nwhile preserving the sentence's grammatical structure. Recent advances in\nLexical Substitution have leveraged the masked token prediction task of\nPre-trained Language Models to generate replacements for a given word in a\nsentence. With this technique, we introduce ConCat, a simple augmented approach\nwhich utilizes the original sentence to bolster contextual information sent to\nthe model. Compared to existing approaches, it proves to be very effective in\nguiding the model to make contextually relevant predictions for the target\nword. Our study includes a quantitative evaluation, measured via sentence\nsimilarity and task performance. In addition, we conduct a qualitative human\nanalysis to validate that users prefer the substitutions proposed by our\nmethod, as opposed to previous methods. Finally, we test our approach on the\nprevailing benchmark for Lexical Substitution, CoInCo, revealing potential\npitfalls of the benchmark. These insights serve as the foundation for a\ncritical discussion on the way in which Lexical Substitution is evaluated.",

Most existing methods for AA are designed for\ncontinuous data and do not exploit the structure of the data distribution. In\nthis paper, we propose two new optimization frameworks for archetypal analysis\nfor binary data. i) A second order approximation of the AA likelihood based on\nthe Bernoulli distribution with efficient closed-form updates using an active\nset procedure for learning the convex combinations defining the archetypes, and\na sequential minimal optimization strategy for learning the observation\nspecific reconstructions. ii) A Bernoulli likelihood based version of the\nprincipal convex hull analysis (PCHA) algorithm originally developed for least\nsquares optimization. We compare these approaches with the only existing binary\nAA procedure relying on multiplicative updates and demonstrate their\nsuperiority on both synthetic and real binary data.

Reinforcement Learning from Human\nFeedback (RLHF) has emerged as a key technique, translating preference data\ninto reward models when oracle human values remain inaccessible.

The literature for image-to-image generative model (I2I model)\nconsiders minimizing the distance between Gaussian noise and the output of I2I\nmodel for forget samples as machine unlearning. However, we argue that the\nmachine learning model performs fairly well on unseen data i.e., a retrained\nmodel will be able to catch generic patterns in the data and hence will not\ngenerate an output which is equivalent to Gaussian noise. In this paper, we\nconsider that the model after unlearning should treat forget samples as\nout-of-distribution (OOD) data, i.e., the unlearned model should no longer\nrecognize or encode the specific patterns found in the forget samples. To\nachieve this, we propose a framework which decouples the model parameters with\ngradient ascent, ensuring that forget samples are OOD for unlearned model with\ntheoretical guarantee. We also provide $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-unlearning\nguarantee for model updates with gradient ascent. The unlearned model is\nfurther fine-tuned on the remaining samples to maintain its performance. We\nalso propose an attack model to ensure that the unlearned model has effectively\nremoved the influence of forget samples.

Holding maneuvers occur when aircraft are instructed to circle in\ndesignated airspace, often due to factors such as airport congestion, adverse\nweather, or air traffic control restrictions. This study models the prediction\nof flight delays due to holding maneuvers as a graph problem, leveraging\nadvanced Graph Machine Learning (Graph ML) techniques to capture complex\ninterdependencies in air traffic networks. Holding maneuvers, while crucial for\nsafety, cause increased fuel usage, emissions, and passenger dissatisfaction,\nmaking accurate prediction essential for operational efficiency. Traditional\nmachine learning models, typically using tabular data, often overlook\nspatial-temporal relations within air traffic data. To address this, we model\nthe problem of predicting holding as edge feature prediction in a directed\n(multi)graph where we apply both CatBoost, enriched with graph features\ncapturing network centrality and connectivity, and Graph Attention Networks\n(GATs), which excel in relational data contexts. Our results indicate that\nCatBoost outperforms GAT in this imbalanced dataset, effectively predicting\nholding events and offering interpretability through graph-based feature\nimportance.

During AT, the length of adversarial prompts plays\na critical role in the robustness of aligned LLMs. This paper focuses on\nadversarial suffix jailbreak attacks and unveils that to defend against a\njailbreak attack with an adversarial suffix of length $\\Theta(M)$, it is enough\nto align LLMs on prompts with adversarial suffixes of length\n$\\Theta(\\sqrt{M})$.

The Mondrian\nkernel is one such example of a fast random feature approximation of the\nLaplace kernel, generated by a computationally efficient hierarchical random\npartition of the input space known as the Mondrian process. In this work, we\nstudy a variation of this random feature map by using uniformly randomly\nrotated Mondrian processes to approximate a kernel that is invariant under\nrotations. We obtain a closed-form expression for this isotropic kernel, as\nwell as a uniform convergence rate of the uniformly rotated Mondrian kernel to\nthis limit. To this end, we utilize techniques from the theory of stationary\nrandom tessellations in stochastic geometry and prove a new result on the\ngeometry of the typical cell of the superposition of uniformly random rotations\nof Mondrian tessellations. Finally, we test the empirical performance of this\nrandom feature map on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its\nimproved performance over the Mondrian kernel on a debiased dataset.",

            "summary": "Solving hard optimization problems is one of the most promising application\ndomains for quantum computers due to the ubiquity of such problems in industry\nand the availability of broadly applicable quantum speedups. However, the\nability of near-term quantum computers to tackle industrial-scale optimization\nproblems is limited by their size and the overheads of quantum error\ncorrection. Quantum Random Access Optimization (QRAO) has been proposed to\nreduce the space requirements of quantum optimization. However, to date QRAO\nhas only been implemented using variational algorithms, which suffer from the\nneed to train instance-specific variational parameters, making them difficult\nto scale. We propose and benchmark a non-variational approach to QRAO based on\nthe Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA) for the MaxCut problem. We show\nthat instance-independent ``fixed'' parameters achieve good performance,\nremoving the need for variational parameter optimization. Additionally, we\nevaluate different design choices, such as various mixers and initial states,\nas well as QAOA operator implementations when customizing for QRAO, and\nidentify a strategy that performs well in practice. Our results pave the way\nfor the practical execution of QRAO on early fault-tolerant quantum computers.",

            "summary": "In October 2023, 23andMe, a prominent provider of personal genetic testing,\nancestry, and health information services, suffered a significant data breach\norchestrated by a cybercriminal known as ``Golem.'' Initially, approximately\n14,000 user accounts were compromised by a credential smear attack, exploiting\nreused usernames and passwords from previous data leaks. However, due to the\ninterconnected nature of 23andMe's DNA Relatives and Family Tree features, the\nbreach expanded exponentially, exposing sensitive personal and genetic data of\napproximately 5.5 million users and 1.4 million additional profiles. The attack\nhighlights the increasing threat of credential stuffing, exacerbated by poor\npassword hygiene and the absence of robust security measures such as\nmulti-factor authentication (MFA) and rate limiting. In response, 23andMe\nmandated password resets, implemented email-based two-step verification, and\nadvised users to update passwords across other services. This paper critically\nanalyzes the attack methodology, its impact on users and the company, and\nexplores potential mitigation strategies, including enhanced authentication\nprotocols, proactive breach detection, and improved cybersecurity practices.\nThe findings underscore the necessity of stronger user authentication measures\nand corporate responsibility in safeguarding sensitive genetic and personal\ndata.",

            "summary": "Dataset distillation (DD) enhances training efficiency and reduces bandwidth\nby condensing large datasets into smaller synthetic ones. It enables models to\nachieve performance comparable to those trained on the raw full dataset and has\nbecome a widely adopted method for data sharing. However, security concerns in\nDD remain underexplored. Existing studies typically assume that malicious\nbehavior originates from dataset owners during the initial distillation\nprocess, where backdoors are injected into raw datasets. In contrast, this work\nis the first to address a more realistic and concerning threat: attackers may\nintercept the dataset distribution process, inject backdoors into the distilled\ndatasets, and redistribute them to users. While distilled datasets were\npreviously considered resistant to backdoor attacks, we demonstrate that they\nremain vulnerable to such attacks. Furthermore, we show that attackers do not\neven require access to any raw data to inject the backdoors successfully.\nSpecifically, our approach reconstructs conceptual archetypes for each class\nfrom the model trained on the distilled dataset. Backdoors are then injected\ninto these archetypes to update the distilled dataset. Moreover, we ensure the\nupdated dataset not only retains the backdoor but also preserves the original\noptimization trajectory, thus maintaining the knowledge of the raw dataset. To\nachieve this, a hybrid loss is designed to integrate backdoor information along\nthe benign optimization trajectory, ensuring that previously learned\ninformation is not forgotten. Extensive experiments demonstrate that distilled\ndatasets are highly vulnerable to backdoor attacks, with risks pervasive across\nvarious raw datasets, distillation methods, and downstream training strategies.\nMoreover, our attack method is efficient, capable of synthesizing a malicious\ndistilled dataset in under one minute in certain cases.",

As Android apps\nincreasingly incorporate login functionalities, they support a variety of\nauthentication methods with complicated login processes, catering to\npersonalized user experiences.

We analyze 361 issues from 44 popular open-source Android\nrepositories, examining the root causes, symptoms, and trigger conditions of\nthese issues. Our findings indicate that the vast majority of the login issues\nare induced by the improper handling of complex state transitions during the\nlogin process, which can prevent users from logging in or misdirect them to\nincorrect subsequent actions. Additionally, we observed that issues related to\nthis cause typically require the convergence of multiple trigger conditions to\nmanifest.
